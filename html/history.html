                    Food waste was never inexistent, but the numbers have been steadily growing each year.
                    <br> Though the percentage of food being recycled or thrown into compost are also increasing, since the food waste itself is growing too, the food going to landfill is increasing â€“ and this needs to end.
                </p>
                <p class="scrollFade" id='two'>
                    This problem worsened when grocery stores started putting "Best By" and "Use Before" labels on foods, in the 1970s.
                    <br> The industry mainly puts those dates based on absolutely optimal freshness of the food, but the consumers don't know that and they throw out perfectly safe products.
                </p>
                <p class="scrollFade" id='three'>
                    Other causes of this issue are foods spoiling in transit or imperfect-looking products.
                    <br> In fact, food waste is so bad, that if it were its own country, it would be the third largest country, behind China and the U.S.
                </p>
                <p class="scrollFade" id='four'>
                    However, most food that are lost are long gone before they even reach any household, and instead are incarcenated because of their ugly shapes, or even not even harvested due to labor shortages, or food safety scares.
                    <br> Telling families to reduce food waste may have effect, but to make drastic changes, we think it is necessary to make laws to regulate the food wasted by companies and farmers.
